## Introduction
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.<br>
    This project focuses on the short-term forecasting of the shared bikes demand in Seoul using a Machine learning approach. It practically contributes to increasing operational efficiency and reducing operating costs by improving demand predictability in a bike-sharing system.<br>
    Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills and using different regression machine learning models calculated the best result in this project.
